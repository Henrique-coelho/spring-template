# SPRING TEMPLATE
This repo contains a basic template for spring projects, feel free to use it.

## Reminders

That repo uses postgreSQL but you can change it on the application.properties file, and don't forget to set your spring.datasource.url on it.
You can change the JDK version on the pom.xml file.
